# Resilient Workflows

"Software Defined Assets" developed using [Dagster](https://dagster.io)

The first step is to rewrite the 'digests' as a news and publications workflow that are
more easily maintainable and customizable, and not bound to the code project that runs the user interface


## Deployment
Deployment will be done with containers where each workfow will run in separate  code container.
This will allow for workflows to be developed independently and be isolated in case constraints come up.
